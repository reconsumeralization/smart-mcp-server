# Freight and Logistics Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate the Smart MCP Server with freight and logistics operations using our comprehensive workflow system.

## Overview

The freight and logistics integration workflow automates the entire process of handling shipping documents, from EDI processing to route optimization and stakeholder notifications. It leverages multiple MCP tools to create a seamless, end-to-end solution.

## Features

- **EDI Document Processing**: Automated handling of common EDI documents (856, 204, 214, 990)
- **AI-Powered Data Extraction**: Uses Gemini AI to extract structured data from shipping documents
- **Route Optimization**: Integration with external routing services
- **Real-time Updates**: Automated notifications to all stakeholders
- **Document Archival**: Systematic storage of all shipping documents
- **Compliance**: Built-in validation and error handling
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and SLA tracking

## Prerequisites

1. MCP Server setup with the following tools enabled:
   - EDI X12 Tool
   - Gemini Tool
   - REST API Tool
   - SQL Server Tool
   - AS2 Tool
   - Notification Tool
   - SharePoint Tool

2. Required API Keys and Credentials:
   - Routing API credentials
   - Database connection details
   - AS2 certificates and partner profiles
   - SharePoint credentials

3. Environment Variables:
   ```env
   ROUTING_API_ENDPOINT=https://your-routing-service.com/api
   ROUTING_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@your-company.com
   ```

## Workflow Steps

### 1. EDI Document Processing
- Handles incoming EDI documents
- Validates against X12 standards
- Converts to JSON for easier processing

### 2. Shipment Data Extraction
- Uses Gemini AI to extract key information
- Focuses on shipment details and special requirements
- Structures data for downstream processing

### 3. Route Optimization
- Sends shipment data to routing service
- Considers time windows, vehicle capacity, and HOS regulations
- Returns optimized routes and ETAs

### 4. Database Update
- Updates TMS with new shipment information
- Maintains data consistency
- Enables tracking and reporting

### 5. Partner Notification
- Sends updates via AS2
- Uses standard EDI 214 format
- Ensures secure transmission with encryption

### 6. Stakeholder Notification
- Multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, webhook)
- Customizable templates
- Real-time status updates

### 7. Document Archival
- Organizes documents by date
- Adds relevant metadata
- Ensures compliance and auditability

## Implementation

### 1. Register the Workflow

```bash
curl -X POST http://your-mcp-server/api/workflows \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @examples/freight-logistics-workflow.json
```

### 2. Configure Partner Profiles

Create partner profiles for AS2 communication:

```javascript
const partnerProfile = {
  id: "PARTNER001",
  name: "Logistics Partner",
  as2: {
    id: "AS2_ID",
    url: "https://partner-as2-endpoint.com",
    certificate: "path/to/cert.pem"
  }
};
```

### 3. Set Up Notifications

Configure notification templates:

```javascript
const template = {
  id: "shipment-update",
  subject: "Shipment ${shipmentId} Status Update",
  body: "Your shipment has been ${status}. ETA: ${eta}",
  channels: ["email", "sms", "webhook"]
};
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Metrics to Monitor

1. Processing Time
   - Document processing duration
   - End-to-end workflow completion time

2. Error Rates
   - EDI validation errors
   - Route optimization failures
   - Notification delivery issues

3. Business Metrics
   - Number of shipments processed
   - Route optimization savings
   - Partner response times

### Alerts

Configure alerts for:
- High error rates (>5% in 5-minute window)
- Slow processing (>30s per document)
- SLA violations
- Failed partner notifications

## Error Handling

The workflow includes comprehensive error handling:

1. Automatic Retries
   - 3 retries with exponential backoff
   - Different strategies for different error types

2. Fallback Actions
   - Human review for EDI errors
   - Alternative routing services
   - Manual notification processes

3. Error Logging
   - Detailed error tracking
   - Admin notifications for critical issues

## Best Practices

1. Document Handling
   - Always validate EDI documents
   - Maintain original documents in archive
   - Use consistent naming conventions

2. Partner Communication
   - Test AS2 connections regularly
   - Monitor MDN responses
   - Maintain partner profile updates

3. Performance Optimization
   - Monitor processing times
   - Adjust concurrency limits as needed
   - Regular database maintenance

4. Security
   - Keep certificates up to date
   - Regular security audits
   - Monitor access logs

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. EDI Processing Errors
   - Check document format
   - Verify partner profiles
   - Review validation rules

2. Route Optimization Failures
   - Verify API credentials
   - Check input data format
   - Monitor API status

3. Notification Issues
   - Verify recipient information
   - Check template formatting
   - Monitor delivery status
